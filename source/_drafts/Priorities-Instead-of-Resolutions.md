title: Priorities Instead of Resolutions in 2017

I cannot remember why or how I decided last December (2015) to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube. I probably just stumbled across some post somewhere and then made an impulsive Amazon buy. This is a common pattern for me: I try many things but stick with few. On the upside, I'm very good at triaging things and connecting new knowledge into my existing frameworks. The downside is that I've always struggled at learning or doing something completely new without some existing framework or related skills.

When the cube arrived at the start of my holiday vacation time, I sat down and started to learn how to solve with a beginner's method tutorial. Three concepts converged for me, but I could not articulate these until now how they interact.

## Decompose an impossible quest into a series of possible tasks

As an educator it's obvious that students must learn fundamentals and then extend through practice on the way to master. While I know this conceptually, it is a lot harder to follow these rules when you are self-learning. Mentors are immensely valuable, and you should definitely try to find them, but not everything you want to do warrants mentorship.

I wanted to solve this Rubik's cube. I had no specific timeline or reason for solving it, so I didn't have any external factors compelling me to overly focus on the end result. The beginner tutorial broke down the solution into seven steps, so I asked myself how I would feel if I consistently could solve the first step in a week. This felt both good and reasonable. My journey began.

Although tempted to plow ahead and follow all the the steps to solve, I somehow restrained myself to only work on this very first step for a full week. I found gratification in the small movements of this single step, and this was enough upside to keep me focused on truly learning the foundation instead of looking ahead.

I enjoyed the learning the first step during my first week, so I moved on to the second step. Then the third and fourth. The fifth and sixth steps took more focus to learn, buy I already was a month along this path and in a groove. Keeping going seemed like a more natural action than stopping. Fiddling with the cube was part of my routine now.

I actually never solved the cube a single time until I began practicing the seventh (and final) step. While I absolutely felt extra satisfied when I finally solved the cube for the first time, I found nearly as much satisfaction in becoming more proficient with the leading steps.

Because I found enjoyment in the minutiae of each step, I never felt the pressure to fully solve the cube. My goal wasn't to solve the cube. My goal was to just learn one more step.

## Start a new thing when you have extra time

The first week doing anything new sucks. The second week also sucks, but at least you know you can do it. After a couple weeks, most anything becomes routine. Instead of starting new behaviors on January 1st, right when you're going back to work from holiday vacation, start at the beginning of your vacation!

Unplugging for a week or so is great, but you know there is going to be a lot of idle time. For solving the Rubik's cube, I did a little here and there between football bowl games. I practiced in some longer 15- to 30-minute blocks. I was able to spend time with all of my visiting relatives and still slide in practice when I had no other pressures from work on my mind.

The sweet spot for me seems to be 30 minutes for three times per week as a minimum. I can do more, but I cannot do less. Thirty minutes provides enough time to switch contexts and focus on the task. If I feel like going for an hour, no harm, but I still have to practice the new thing three times per week for a minimum of 30 minutes per session.

I'm trying not to bite off too much. I have a lifetime of stuff to learn and skills to improve, so I'm limiting myself to three priorities per year. Adding up my minimal time commitments, this means I just need to commit to a minimum of 4.5 hours per week. That's not much! Again, there's nothing stopping me from spending more time if I'm feeling good and can afford the time, but at least I've set a baseline. I won't be world-class by spending 78 hours minimum per year on a new thing, but I'll sure as heck be immensely better than I was before.

90 minutes per week doesn't sound like a lot of commitment, but I know of myself that I drop the new stuff fast when work and life pressures are high. Staring new things during a period of low pressure, like holiday breaks, worked tremendously well for me.

## Emphasize good behavior instead of eliminating bad behavior

My second priority for 2016 was to get back in shape. Before I had a family, I was more able to follow a restrictive diet. I'd also try stuff like "no beer during the week," but then a friend would come into town or I'd have a work outing. While I could follow these kind of punishment plans for a little while, ultra-restrictive eating is difficult to sustain longterm and just not possible to follow when you actually interact with other humans.

Instead of focusing on eliminating bad things, this year I emphasized increasing positive behaviors. For my dieting, I decided to eat five salads per week. No other rules. I still eat the same dinner with the family, and I can have beers with friends. Previously I ate zero salads per week. While such a narrow focus may seem fruitless, it gave me a strategy that I could follow perfectly. I didn't have to eat salads every lunch, but that is my go to meal. If a friend is visiting, or I have a business lunch, I'll eat whatever looks good -- burger, tacos, whatever -- then I just have to make up my salad some other time during the week.

Emphasizing good behavior got me into a mindset of favoring action. My rule to just do the good behavior of eating salads five times per week had the natural consequence of eliminating some of my unhealthy eating because, hey, there are just so many meals in a week. Instead of feeling guilty for breaking a rule, I always felt good when I checked off one of my salads. I'm ending 2016 down 40 pounds and at my leanest in a decade.

## 2017: Diversify and generalize priorities
