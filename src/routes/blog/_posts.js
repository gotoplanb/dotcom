		title: 'Walkthrough: Prepare for Your Heroku Architecture Credential',
		slug: 'walk-heroku-cert',
		html: `
			<p>The Heroku Architecture credential is an official certification by Salesforce administered through Webassessor. It is atypical for Salesforce certifications, as Heroku is a standalone platform and not run on the Salesforce Platform. Other Salesforce certifications have a bunch of hand's on Trailhead trails to help you get experience. The Heroku Architecture certification, however, is more similar in style to the Amazon Web Services certification exams that assume you already have a few years of experience on the platform before sitting the exam.</p>

			<p>While nothing beats practical experience with Heroku, the concepts should be quite familiar for people with strong fundamentals of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider like Amazon Web Services. In this walkthrough of the <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-heroku-architecture-credential">Prepare for Your Heroku Architecture Credential</a> trailmix, I will go through each of the suggested documents and provide my highlights. I will also try to map the Heroku service to a comparable or complimentary AWS service when possible. My objective is to make it easier for an AWS-certified professional to get up to speed with Heroku, pass the certification exam, and have a solid understanding of how to use Heroku and AWS together.</p>

			<h2>Heroku Architecture Credential Overview</h2>

			<p>My first impression is the audience is closest to AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate content with some sprinkles of the AWS Certified Developer Associate. The primary focus is to know what services are avialble and how to architect a solution versus knowing how to do things on the job.</p>
			
			<p>Heroku Enterprise is similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, in that you really just care about your application code and don't need to worry about the underlying infrastracture. Code runs in a container. There are preconfigured stacks, or you can define your own via buildpacks. The security and trust concepts are akin to AWS IAM and can similar hook into additional auth providers for SSO.</p>

			<p>Heroku Postgres is wonderful. AWS provides Postgres through the RDS service. There are pretty simple ways to do replication between AWS and Heroku. I assume future sections of the study guide will cover this stuff. The exam also covers Redis, which is part of the AWS ElastiCache service.</p>

			<p>You use Heroku Add-ons for things like data stores, logs, etc. that you would just provision directly in AWS. The real interesting distinction is that Heroku treats and app as the primary container for components. You provision an add-on for an existing app. Add-ons do not stand alone. For example, you create your an app that has by default some web server. Then, you can provision Posgres, Redis, logs, etc. to be attached to the app. All the auth stuff is handled for you via environmental variables instead of you having to create a bunch of AWS IAM policies to auth between all the services. Heroku does not give you the super granular control like AWS IAM but wow is it so much simpler to use while maintaining trust and security.</p>

			<p>Heroku Private Spaces are basically a branded verison of an AWS VPC. You use Private Spaces to have internal-only routing of traffic between apps and add-ons -- data does not traverse the public internet to get between components. This is tremendously valuable in regulated industries and also just as a stronger security posture. Heroku Private Spaces can also peer to an AWS VPC through the same kind of VPC-peering pattern you would use to peer two AWS VPCs. Private spaces are a great way to follow Twelve-Factor methodology while also complying with industry standards.</p>

			<p>Heroku Connect is a connector and integration tool to map and sync data between a Postgres database and a Salesforce instance, which Salesforce folks refer to as an organization or just "org" for short. Heroku Connect allows for mapping between tables, choosing direction and frequency of sync, and a bunch more we'll go through later. Heroku Connect can connect to any Postgres database, not just those running inside Heroku. Heroku Connect is a unique service. You could recreate the functionality using AWS Data Pipelines and EC2, but it would be a huge pain.</p>

			<p>Heroku Kafka is a manged version of Kafka. None of the AWS certification exams get into Kafka yet, but the use case is simliar to how AWS recommends AWS SNS and AWS SQS to create decoupled message-driven applications. AWS Kinesis is a similar queueing solution to Kafka. Yes there are differences, but the fundmental information regarding sharding, ordering, producers, and consumers should be similar as far as the certification exams are concerned.</p>

			<h2>The Heroku Dev Center</h2>

			<p>The Trailmix says this is a 5-minute link. Ha. To do this section right, expect to spend at least an hour to follow every step and do some additional fiddling.</p>

			<p>Heroku provides a getting-started guide using your language of choice. I went with JavaScript/Node. I had previously installed the Heroku CLI, so I made sure to run <code>brew update && brew upgrade && heroku --version</code> to make sure I was on the latest stable version. I'm using v7.26.2 at the time of writing this walkthrough.</p>

			<p>The sample app install works as expected. I also suggest you add the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli-autocomplete">autocomplete plugin</a> to make CLI usage much easier. Also, as we cloned the example project from GitHub, you might want to get rid of the origin remote, as you will never be pushing back to it. <code>git remote -v</code> to see all the remotes. You should <code>origin</code> from when you did the origin clone and <code>heroku</code> remote as a result of running the <code>heroku create</code> command. You can remove the GitHub remote by running <code>git remote rm origin</code>. If you run into an error when you try to provision compute resources with <code>heroku ps:scale web=1</code>, make sure you actually deployed the app with <code>git push heroku master</code> first.</p>

			<p>Heroku Dynos are the primary compute resource you will use. They are kind of like AWS EC2 instances but with all the complexity taken care of for you. You can either manually or auto scale, and you can run most any application code by including a <code>Procfile</code>, which is akin to an AWS CloudFormation template. The whole flow of Heroku is most similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk including pipelines, slots, and one-click promotion of an app between environments for blue-green deployments. In my opinion you should always use Heroku instead of AWS Elastric Beanstalk. There are some exceptions, but this is a very good rule to follow. Use AWS if you have intense container-management needs and ultra-particularly access requirements, and then have development teams use Heroku Pipelines.</p>

			<p>As you start setting up Heroku Piplines, which I'm sure we will cover later, you won't necessarily have a git remote named <code>heroku</code>, as you instead setup continuous integration and deployments from a hosted git remote like GitHub or GitLab. In this scenario, pretty much ever CLI command is going to fail for you because the CLI won't implictly understand which app you are targeting without having the heroku remote tracked in the local git config. No worries, you can just by using the app argument and explictly pass the name of the app. You can test this by changing to some other arbitrary directory on your computer and then running <code>heroku logs --tail --app morning-cliffs-8675309</code>. Substitute in your app's name. This is where the CLI autocomplete becomes super handy.</p>

			<p><code>heroku local web</code> run your app locally, but this warrants some further explanation. Really you're just running a local webserver. The rest of your add-ons are probably running on Heroku. So, you do get some benefits of having your app rebuilding on local code changes and before you commit to git, but you aren't getting an offline environment. If you want to be able to develop online, you'll have a ton of additional work to setup mocks or run stuff Postgres, etc. locally. Postgres is easy enough to run locally and then use environmental variables to use a local db host when running the web server locall, but this becomes a huge pain if you go all-in with Heroku and us add-ons for auth and whatnot. tl;dr Assume that you need to be online to develop apps for Heroku when you are using anything other than just dynos/compute.</p>

			<p>Heroku add-ons are great. Use Papertrail on every project as a default. It's also super handy that you can SSO from Heroku into pretty much every add-on's management concsole, saving you a ton of headache managing secrets on your team. Just control access to the apps themselves, and then people can get into the add-ons they need. It's actaully quite amazing how many add-ons have free tiers. Also, you don't have to worry about unexpected bills. If you reach a tier maximum, Heroku will tell you the add-on will stop working. It's up to you to then scale that add-on to a paid tier. This is in stark contrast to AWS, where pretty much everythign costs some money to use, and if you leave on certain resources, you can quickly wake up to a few hundred dollars in unexpected charges. Heroku is much safer for experimenting with add-ons.</p>

			<p><code>heroku run bash</code> creates a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos">one-off dyno</a> for tasks for the app. These one-off dynos are not meant for editing files. You can even experiment by using Bash to delete whatever files you want, but then when you via the app in browser, all will function normally. Instead, use the one-off instances for running database migrations or other kinds of data-modeling introspection. Use <code>heroku run:detached</code> to send output to your logs/Papertrail instead of the console.</code></p>

			<p>Run <code>heroku ps</code> to see what processess you have running. Heroku is super nice to even tell you which pricing tier for each process. You should stop processess you no longer need to conserve your free time or cash money. One-off dynos are shut off after one hour of inactivity. <code>heroku ps:stop web.1</code> will idle your web server. This is like turning off an AWS EC2 instance. Once you visit the URL for the app, Heroku will nicely start the web server for you. You'll notice a slow load the first time as the web server gets going. Heroku <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping">auto-sleeps dynos</a> that haven't served a request for 30 minutes. Heroku does this to save themselves some money, but it also helps the user to not run out of free time. If you can't tolerate the few seconds it takes a dyno to power up after activity, you probably want to scale to the Hobby dyno tier. There are different ways to keep dynos alive, but if you are hacking this limit, you are probably just going to cause yourself some other problem. That said, you can install the <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/newrelic">New Relic</a> monitoring add-on and set a reporting interval of 30 seconds. New Relic is great, and you probably want to consider for your product apps anyway.</p>

			<p>When you start modifying <code>index.js</code>, be sure that you are adding your additional <code>.get</code> routes before the line with <code>.listen</code> or else the routes will not be available and the web server will crash.</p>

			<p>You set enviornmental variables locally via the <code>.env</code> file and then run <code>heroku local</code> to load the environmental variables and then the web server. To update environmental variables for your Heroku apps, you either can set in the CLI via <code>heroku config:set <key>:<value></code> or via the browser-based management console for your apps at a URL like <code>https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/morning-cliffs-8675309/settings</code>.</p>

			<p>Getting PostgreSQL running can be a little bit of a pain. I used <code>brew cask install postgres</code> and then started the local database server with TODO. If you're going to be actually using Heroku, you will be using Posgres a lot, so it is worth it to buy a client like <a href="https://macpostgresclient.com/">SQLPro for Postgres</a>. If you run <code>heroku config</code> to get the database connection string, you can split out all the pieces you need to connect from SQLPro for Postgres directly to your Heroku Postgres database. For example: <code>user = rmxfxlaxgoetzy , password = ab0097923284d13a9d8a87068f6abb40da39cd2688b72a5dfcf832addba775ae , host = ec2-107-20-237-237.compute-1.amazonaws.com , port = 5432 , database = 2dq5lmvp72fdec</code></p>

			<h2>How Heroku Works</h2>

			<p>Heroku should auto-run your apps by analyzing the file types. If you need anything other than barebones defaults, you probably will use a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile">Procfile</a> to define the stack and build configuration. Each line of the <code>Procfile</code> let's to target a process and pass the command that process should run. For example: <code>web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT</code> for a Rails project.</p>

			<p>Deployments are done via Git. You can either push a Git commit to Heroku and cause the app to build or you can push to an arbitrary Git remote (e.g. GitHub) and then have Heroku listening for changes. On commit to the remote, Heroku can pull and build.</p>

			<p>Commands you will use often:</>

			<dl>
				<dt><code>heroku ps</code></dt>
				<dd>List processes for the given app</dd>
			</dl>

			<dl>
				<dt><code>heroku logs</code></dt>
				<dd>View logs for the app</dd>
			</dl>

			<dl>
				<dt><code>heroku ps:scale web=2 worker=4</code></dt>
				<dd>Scale the web process to 2 dynos and worker process to 4 dynos</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>The names for the process are arbitrary, other than web. You can create whatever processess you want including multiple workers so that you have multiple queues. If you want to build Docker images, use a <code>heroku.yml</code> instead of a <code>Procfile</code>.</p>

			<h2>Heroku Enterprise Basics</h2>

			<p>Most of the Trailhead module is pretty straight forward and a repeat of the work you did in the Heroku getting-started guide. Heroku Enterprise gives you Heroku Connect, single sign-on, Private Spaces, and optionally technical support.</p>
			
			<p>A Heroku Enterprise Team can have admin, member, and viewer roles. Users can have four different "privilege sets" for an app: view, deploy, operate, and manage. Privilege sets are added ad-hoc and are not cumulative. For example, a user could have <code>deploy</code> and <code>operation</code> or maybe just one of them. Review the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-permissions">matrix of privileges by role</a>. All users get <code>view</code> by default. If a user has the <code>manage</code> privilege, then that user can assign themself additional privileges. Only admins can mess with <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/private-spaces#private-space-management">Private Spaces</a>. Enterprise teams can have a whitelist of add-ons, so that members can provision at will for apps within the team. The <code>deploy</code> privilege lets a user provision paid add-ons, while the <code>operate</code> privilege allows for paid add-ons.</p>

			<p>Consolidated billing shows resources usage (e.g. dyno count) and total spend across the team. You also get historical trends. You can set maximums for dynos and aggregate add-on spend per month. These caps are at the team level. I do not think you can set at the app level.</p>

			<p>Heroku Connect syncs data between a Salesforce org and a Postgres database. There is a future section on Heroku Connect, so I will avoid descending into detail for now.</p>

			<p>Heroku Enterprise supports Salesforce Identity, Okta, Bitium, and Ping identity providers by default or any SAML 2.0â€“compliant identity provider if you want it bad enough.</p>

			<p>Heroku Private spaces are basically a whitelabeled AWS VPC. Your resources are collocated, so that all inter-process traffic is kept inside a private IP range and does not traverse the public internet. You pay a lot for this, but you may need to for compliance reasons. Also your latency will be much faster.</p>

			<p>Heroku Enterprise allows you to get more support. There is not standard pricing this support. I assume SLAs are negotiated.</p>

			<p>I wasn't sure whether to work on this Superbadge first or the Lightning Experience Rollout Specialist. Seemed better to know a thing than how to rollout a thing, so here is where I started. Also that other superbadge is estimtated to take twice as long at 12 hours. Yikes! Hopefully going through this superbadge first will help the other go faster.</p>

			<h2>Sections</h2>
			
			<h3>Prework and Notes</h3>

			<p>Remember opportunity product service dates from 1/1/2026 to 12/31/2026.</p>

			<h3>Use Case</h3>

			<p>Nothing to note.</p>

			<h3>Standard Objects</h3>

			<p>You cannot rename standard objects from the Object Manager. Instead you have to use the "Rename Tabs and Labels" screen in Setup. When you try to add Case record types, you will get a message that says you need a Support Process first. I created one called "Issues" and then created the two record types.</p>

			<h3>Custom Objects</h3>

			<h2>Validation</h2>

			<h3>Take the Sales Path quiz</h3>

			<p>Apparently I already took this. I can't remember. I should add some details here or get feedback from other people.</p>

			<h3>Provide in-app guidance to sales reps</h3>

			<p>There is a ton of stuff to do to get this step to pass.</p>
